            <p class="lead">The main goal of this project was to learn about the trainee's needs and find digital solution to fulfill those needs. This was a fun project to build a better understanding of the design thinking methodology, but also a great way to solve the problems faced by trainees pre and post joining. The team enjoyed the effort and I was able to learn more about User research and prototyping the ideas.</p>

            <p class="lead">We divided ourselves in four teams and paired and went on to talk with our users: Trainees. We divided users by different categories: Time spent in Academy, Native Location, College, Technology Track, Placement Type, Waiting Period. Then we listened to their whole journey from getting offer letters to join the Academy. Using funneling we focused on the key points and asked them to elaborate on those.
We called some users who graduated from academy and went to buisness unit and got information on the transition from academy to buisness unit. This gave us a lots of data and now we needed to collect and refine it.</p>

            <p class="lead">From the collected data we created a timeline for the user. From -90 to +275 days, whihc included pre-joining formalities, Joining day Induction, Assessments, Learning schedule, Graduation, Buisness unit Transition and Dovetail assessment. We also created a wall where we categorized the things and ideas in three columns I Like, I Wish and What If. This gave us knowledge of what there is in Academy that users like and can be improved with help of "I Wish" column and "What If" column contained the ideas which users can live without.</p>
